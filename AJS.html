        AngularJS is an open source, JavaScript based web application development
        framework.
        Definition of AngularJS as put by its official documentation is as follows:
        AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. It lets you use
        HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your
        application components clearly and succinctly. Its data binding and dependency
        injection eliminate much of the code you currently have to write. And it all happens
        within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
        It was originally developed in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. It is now
        maintained by Google.
